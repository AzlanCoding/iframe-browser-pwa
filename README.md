The website is here:  <b>

This project is to help students bypass websites accidentally blocked by schools device manager apps (e.g. Mobile guardian) to do reaserch.  <b>
It makes use of iframe to do so. You can call it an iframe browser. <b>
Using this extension to help the site work: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ignore-x-frame-headers/gleekbfjekiniecknbkamfmkohkpodhe <b>
This extension ignores X-frame-headers and Content Security Policy (CSP) Headers. <b>
