browser-in-website project but in a PWA form  
Reference: https://github.com/codepo8/github-page-pwa/blob/main/manifest.webmanifest  
icon from https://www.flaticon.com/free-icons/web-development 
The website is here:  
https://azlancoding.github.io/iframe-browser-pwa/ 
This project is to help students bypass websites blocked by schools device manager apps (e.g. Mobile guardian) to do reaserch.  
It makes use of iframe to do so. You can call it an iframe browser. 
Using this extension to help the site work: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ignore-x-frame-headers/gleekbfjekiniecknbkamfmkohkpodhe 
This extension ignores X-frame-headers and Content Security Policy (CSP) Headers. 
I managed to create a PWA for it: https://azlancoding.github.io/iframe-browser-pwa/
