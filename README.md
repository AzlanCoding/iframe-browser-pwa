This project is to help students bypass websites accidentally blocked by schools device manager apps (e.g. Mobile guardian) to do reaserch.  <br>
It makes use of iframe to do so. You can call it an iframe browser. <br>
Using this extension to help the site work: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ignore-x-frame-headers/gleekbfjekiniecknbkamfmkohkpodhe <br>
This extension ignores X-frame-headers and Content Security Policy (CSP) Headers. <br>
I managed to create a PWA for it. You may install it from the link above. <br>
